# tlstar345

tlstar345 is a simple game, which allows you to move building blocks around 
until they build an encoded pattern. The building blocks can be defined 
arbitrarily by changing the source code. The building blocks are shifted with 
drag and drop. In case of success a music is played.

Build with ember.
