h1. How to set up the target platform

h2. Problem

RAP and the pde-builder are not working perfectly together. Thus: If you have two features in your target platform, which have two times the same plugin, *none* of this two versions is chosen *although* it is maybe selected in the content tab of the target definition file.

This is fine in most combinations of features you use. *But* it gives you a problem if you want to use for example RAP and declarative services. RAP itself comes with a lot of the osgi and equinox plugins. Nevertheless, some are missing (for example org.eclipse.equinox.ds). Adding the org.eclipse.rcp-feature will not work as described above because it adds some of the plugins again.

h2. How to solve it

h3. Prerequisite

Download the latest RAP-runtime and unzip it (*do not install it in eclipse*).

h3. Here comes the rainbow

Copy org.eclipse.equinox.ds and prg.eclipse.osgi.util (ds depends on it) manually to the download RAP-runtime plugins-directory. Now, click on _Add_ to add a new installation to the target platform and select the eclipse-directory of the RAP-runtime (see the screenshots below). Click _Finish_ and activate this target platform by clicking on _Set as target platform_.

h3. Disadvantages

Although this approach solves the duplicate bundle bug, it breaks the easy source code administration. To get it running on a different machine/os you have to download RAP runtime manually and copy the plugins mentioned above. This would be much easier, if an update site mechanism would work.

h2. What else do you need

Add the update site of your eclipse version (for me it is helios) to the target platform and select the EMF RAP feature (see the screenshots above).
