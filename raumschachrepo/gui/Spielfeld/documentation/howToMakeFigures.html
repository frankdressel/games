<title>How to make figures with blender</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Requirements</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Blender 2.49b</li>
	<li>The Three.js library (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/,
	version 17.02.2011)</li>
	<li>Install the export script as described here:
	http://tech.lab212.org/2010/07/export-textured-models-from-blender2-5-to-three-js/.</li>
</ul>

<h1>How to make the figures</h1>
<p>Use Blender to make a figure. Examples can be found in the
Spielfeld plugin.</p>
<p>After you created the figure, save the blender file. After you
saved it successfully export it via File -> Export -> three.js. You have
to modify the exported javascript file manually. Delete in the first
line the absolute path. For example: var
C:\Users\frank\workspaceRaumschach\Spielfeld\javascript\myKnight =
function () => var myKnight = function (). Do the same with the last two
lines. Add the following three lines at the bottom of the function(){} part (at the end of the file):<br>
	this.computeCentroids();<br>
	this.computeFaceNormals();<br>
	this.sortFacesByMaterial();<br>
</p>
<p>In the corresponding html-file, which you use to show the
content, include the exported js-file. After that, you can use the model
from within javascript.</p>
